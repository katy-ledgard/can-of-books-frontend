## Overview
This project is part of the Tech Educators Full-Stack MERN Bootcamp.

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Throughout this module, you'll create a small app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

Storage: As a user, I'd like to view the list of books, so that whenever I visit the page, I can see the a full list of best books.  


## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
